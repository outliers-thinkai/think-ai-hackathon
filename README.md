# think-ai-hackathon
This is a guide to our solution for the Think-AI Hackathon.
## Problematic:
   is crucial to understand the difficulties Moroccans have in gaining access to AI solutions if we are to effectively encourage this demographic to do so. Current AI usage is primarily limited to languages like French or English, leaving no room for Darija, which is a major barrier to cross-border cooperation and local communication.
## Solution:
 The difficulties Moroccans have accessing AI solutions are addressed by our Moroccan Darija AI platform, which offers a variety of AI products in Darija meant to expand. We want to boost the adoption of AI more broadly and enhance international cooperation and communication by providing solutions in their native tongue.
